You will need to install nokogiri from rubygems in order to use this.

It should then work as a "command" feed source in liferea.

Patches welcome.  Particular missing features would be an easy HTTP hosting
method such as a CGI script.  I'd also accept a patch for it to use REXML
instead of nokogiri to reduce dependencies.
